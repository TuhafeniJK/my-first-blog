            <p>In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful. All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds, the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, Master of the Day of Judgment. You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help. Guide us along the Straight Path, the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray. </p>

            <h2><a href="">My second post</a></h2>
            <p>Have you seen the one who denies the ˹final˺ Judgment ? That is the one who repulses the orphan, and does not encourage the feeding of the poor. So woe to those ˹hypocrites˺ who pray yet are unmindful of their prayers; those who ˹only˺ show off, and refuse to give ˹even the simplest˺ aid. </p>
